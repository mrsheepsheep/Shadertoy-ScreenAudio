Quick and dirty JS override to let Shadertoy use the ScreenCapture API rather than Mic to input sound.

Modification is at line 303 *only*.

Don't forget to check the "Allow sound" box and choose one of your screens.

Only works on Chrome (missing sound checkbox in Firefox ?).

Works as of 01/17/2021
